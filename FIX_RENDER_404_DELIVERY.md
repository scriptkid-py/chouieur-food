# 🔧 Fix 404 on /delivery Route - Render

## ✅ Verification
- ✅ Delivery page builds locally (`✓ Compiled /delivery in 6.7s`)
- ✅ Route appears in build output (`/delivery 7.27 kB`)
- ✅ File exists at `src/app/delivery/page.tsx`
- ❌ Render returns 404 - **needs rebuild**

## 🚀 Solution: Force Render to Rebuild

### **Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard**
1. Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your frontend service: `chouieur-express-frontend-t5h8`

### **Step 2: Force Manual Rebuild**
1. Click on your frontend service
2. Go to **"Events"** or **"Logs"** tab
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
4. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for build to complete

### **Step 3: Verify Build Includes Delivery Route**
In the build logs, look for:
```
✓ Route (app) /delivery
```

### **Step 4: Test After Deployment**
1. Visit: `https://chouieur-express-frontend-t5h8.onrender.com/delivery`
2. Should load the Delivery Dashboard
3. Or click "Delivery" in navigation menu

## 🔍 Why This Happens
Render's build cache sometimes doesn't detect new routes. The route exists and builds correctly, but Render needs a fresh build to recognize it.

## ✅ Quick Fix Commands (Alternative)

If manual deploy doesn't work, you can trigger a rebuild via empty commit:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Render rebuild for delivery route"
git push
```

This forces Render to rebuild automatically.

## 📋 What Should Work After Rebuild

- ✅ `/delivery` route accessible
- ✅ "Delivery" link in navigation
- ✅ Delivery dashboard loads
- ✅ Order list displays
- ✅ Status updates work

**The code is correct - just needs Render to rebuild!** 🚀
