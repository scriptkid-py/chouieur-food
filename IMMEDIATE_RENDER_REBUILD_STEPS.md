# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX: Render 404 for /delivery

## ✅ What I Just Did
- Created empty commit to force Render rebuild
- Pushed to GitHub
- Render should auto-detect and rebuild

## ⏱️ What Happens Next
1. **Render auto-detects the push** (usually within 1-2 minutes)
2. **Render starts rebuilding** (check Render dashboard)
3. **Build takes 5-10 minutes**
4. **After build completes**, `/delivery` should work

## 🔍 How to Verify Rebuild Started
1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your frontend service: `chouieur-express-frontend-t5h8`
3. Check "Events" or "Logs" tab
4. Should see: "Deploying..." or "Building..."

## ⚠️ If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Start
**Manual trigger:**
1. Render Dashboard → Your frontend service
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"**
3. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Wait for build

## ✅ After Build Completes
1. Check build logs for: `✓ Route (app) /delivery`
2. Test: `https://chouieur-express-frontend-t5h8.onrender.com/delivery`
3. Should load the Delivery Dashboard

## 📋 Build Should Show
```
✓ Route (app) /delivery                            7.27 kB
```

## 🔧 Why This Works
Empty commit forces Render to:
- Clear build cache
- Rebuild all routes
- Include the new `/delivery` route

**Wait 5-10 minutes after push, then test the delivery page!**
